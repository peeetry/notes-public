## Tips

* On VS Code, you can open the preview tab with ```cmd + shift + v```;
* Make sure you have a white space " " after an markup symbol;
* Always test if it works on you environment. Not every browser or website renders all Markdown styles;
* Markdown accept HTML tags. So if you can't make it with native Markdown, use HTML tags (this includes CSS and JavaScript);
* It is important to edit Markdown using monospaced fonts. Like the VS Code standard, Courier New or Roboto Mono.
* Keep a black line after a marked one. For example:
