## 5. Linking your traffic to the Azion platform {#linking}

After associating a Domain Name System (DNS) with your Edge Application on the RTM, you must tell your DNS provider where to redirect users that access your domain.

Go to the your DNS provider and add the *link to your **Edge Application*** as an *ALIAS* (also know as *ANAME* or just *A*). 

> This process may change from different DNS providers.
